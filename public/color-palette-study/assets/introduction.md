# Welcome to the Color Palette Comparison Study!

In this experiment, you will be presented pairs of color palettes, one on the left and one on the right. There will be a slider in the middle to indicate preferences.

## Here is an example of what a trial will look like:

## How the experiment works
1. On each trial, you will see **two color palettes** displayed side by side, along with example visualizations (a map, a bar chart, and a scatterplot)
2. Your task is to use the **slider in the middle** to indicate your preference between the two palettes

- You can drag the slider:
   - Left to indicate how much you prefer the **left** palette  
   - Right to indicate how much you prefer the **right** palette  
   - Or center the slider to indicate **no preference**
3. Click **“Next”** to move to the next comparison

**Please note** that the "Next" button will be enabled only after moving the slider. If you wish to indicate "no preference", move the slider and then center it back to "no preference".

## What to expect
- During the experiment, you will complete many such trials
- The experiment is divided into **6 blocks**, with **5 short breaks** indicating your progress. There will be a break after you have completed every block.
- Total time for the experiment is approximately **25-30 minutes**

Please take your time when making each comparison. There are no right or wrong answers.

When you are ready, click **“Next”** to begin!
