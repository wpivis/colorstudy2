In this experiment, you will be presented **pairs of color palettes** along with example visualizations, one on the left and one on the right, displayed side-by-side like below:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center;">

  <img 
    src="color-palette-study/assets/example_trial.png" 
    alt="Example trial"
    style="max-width: 730px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;"
  />
</div>

Your task is to use the **slider in the middle** to indicate your preference between the two palettes.
- You can drag the slider **left** if you like the left palette better, **right** if you like the right palette better, or center the slider at **no preference** if you like them both equally.
- Please use the **full range** of the scale to indicate how strongly you feel. For example, if you like one palette only slightly more, move the slider just a little in that direction. If you prefer it much more strongly, move the slider closer to the extreme end of the scale. 
- **Please note** that in order to move onto the next trial, it will be necessary to move the slider and then press the **Spacebar**.

The experiment is divided into **6 blocks**, with a **short break** after each block to indicate your progress. Total time for the experiment is approximately **25-30 minutes**.
